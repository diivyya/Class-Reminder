# Class-Reminder
Pings you on WhatsApp/Discord when your class scheduled starts and class ends.

```
    If you are also lazy as me to check the time table of class everytime & sometimes forget to join the class then
    then meet your friend "Class Reminder" she will ping you on your discord whenever a class 
    starts and class ends.
